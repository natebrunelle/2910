Schedule
========
The main time commitment of this course is being a TA.  Three hours per week of your TAship this semester is unpaid and counts as the principle assignment of this course.  If you are enrolled for two or more credits of 2910, you need to work (credits × 3) hours per week unpaid for this course.  There will also be some meetings and other activities, as outlined below.

Some sessions will be mandatory (topics like ethics and diversity) and others optional (topics like learning theories and TPEGS).  You will be **required to attend all required sessions and a subset of the optional sessions**.  Attending additional instances of the same session does not count toward your minimum optional session count.

## Meeting Times

We will begin meeting during the third week of classes.
We will have several meeting times, designed to match all TA schedules.
Please list *all* possible times for a meeting using [when2meet](http://www.when2meet.com/?6277098-Fu83X).
Note: **don't be picky**: I have dozens of schedules to intersect.
