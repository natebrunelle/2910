Session 3: Diversity
====================

1.  Stereotype Threat
    -   Awareness of a stereotype against you reduces your performance
        -   Example: old people will do worse on memory tests if I ask their age or put them in a room with young people than if I do not remind them of their age.
    -   Inhibitive: (almost) only *reduces* performance
    -   Universal: known to apply to at least computing, golf, math, memory, math, writing
    -   Easy to trigger: myth busting, room decorations, music, etc.
    -   Not based on truth: I can *make up* a stereotype, teach it to you, and see the effect of stereotype threat.

2.  Culture is our Enemy
    -   There is an ambient message telling *most* demographies that computing is "not for them"
    -   These can attack
        -   Belonging -  "don't you feel out of place?"
        -   Confidence - "you can't compete with all those *X*s..."
        -   Identity -   "*we* don't do that", "traitor"
    -   Some students have counter-cultural leanings
        -   See cultural repression as a challenge to be conquered
        -   Mostly safe from diversity-repressing forces, but also not best role models for others...

3.  Growth Mindset
    -   Nature vs Nurture?
    -   Fixed vs Growth mindset
        
        Fixed
        :   -   Sees nature predominant
            -   Wording like "gifted", "you are good at", "smart"
            -   Tend to avoid challenges as potential evidence of lack of skill
            -   Strongly influenced by opinions of others
        
        Growth
        :   -   Sees nurture predominant
            -   Wording like "experienced", "worked hard", "diligent"
            -   Tend to embrace challenges as avenues for betterment
            -   Weakly influenced by opinions of others
        
    -   Evidence about nature vs nurture is mixed and inconclusive
    -   Evidence about mindset of students and teachers clear
        -   Growth mindset reduces impact of stereotype threat
        -   Growth mindset increases learning and performance
        -   True of both students *and* teachers
    -   My pitch:
        -   A personal trainer is hired to help *every* trainee bulk up, not to find the biggest people
        -   You are cognitive personal trainers

4.  Unequal prior experience playing field
    -   Different cultures, genders, socio-economic backgrounds engage in different childhood activities
    -   Some build more useful prior knowledge than others
    -   Example: spatial reasoning
        -   boys tend to play with more building toys than girls
        -   building toys enhance ability to hold spatial information in the mind
        -   large portions of CS are described using spatial analogy (call *stack*, binary *tree*, variable-as-*box*, program *flow*, …)
        -   … giving average boy a leg up
        -   solution: use manipulatives (e.g., physical stacks of paper to be the call stack, not just verbal "is on top of" that relies on student's ability to hold a stack in their head).
    -   Do not mistake experience for aptitude
