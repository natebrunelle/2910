Session 2: Learning
===================

1.  Discussion of [the reading](fish.html)

    -   Why look at a fish if you want to be an etymologist?
    -   What is the equivalent activity in CS?
    -   Why eight months of this?  Would it have been better or worse with less time?
    -   Was Professor Agassiz wise to do what he did?

2.  Learning

    -   Caveat: I have not formal training in cognitive science.
    -   Much of your brain is automatically pre-processing information for your conscious mind to work with.
    -   Example: `7 + 3`.
        -   your brain probably supplies you with `ten` and `a sum` and `seven` and `three`.
        -   but it used to just do `math` `plus`, `three` and `seven`.
        -   and before that `angular line`, `crossing lines`, and `stacked curved lines`.
    -   The sensation-into-information routines are schemata (for example, seeing `7` â†’ thinking "seven" is a schema).
    -   You can also do those translations consciously where you do not yet have schemata.
    -   Depending on how you measure, your working memory can hold 3-4 ideas at a time.
        -   The load on that memory is split into three uses:
            1.  **Intrinsic load** is needed to do the task at hand.  You can't sum numbers without the numbers in your mind.  But intrinsic load depends on your available schemata; for many of us, `7 + 3` is resolved to "ten" subconsciously.
            2.  **Extraneous load** is distractions, like "I'm hungry" and "that's an odd accent" and "why does it smell like a gym in here?" and "I'm so stressed!"
            3.  **Germane load** is used by the learning part of your brain to build schemata.
        -   Roughly speaking, the goal of educators is
            -   Make tasks small enough not to overload memory with intrinsic load
            -   Make tasks large enough there is scope for building new schemata
            -   Minimize the extraneous load, thus maximizing the germane load

3.  Self-distraction and Stress

    -   People often create their own extraneous load because they are
        -   Bored (the mind wanders)
        -   Stressed (one definition of stress: wasting time thinking about how stressed you are)
    -   Thus you, as a TA, want to be
        -   Interesting (but not too distracting)
        -   Calming
    -   A hurried-, stressed-, or annoyed-seeming TA can add stress to students, impeding learning and increasing TA workload
        -   TAing is in part a form of [emotional labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_labor)

4.  Aside: learning styles

    -   There are different ways to present information: a picture, a story, an example, manipulatives, acting it out, etc.
    -   Research suggests that
        -   Most people have a preferred presentation style (one might be happier with pictures than with words, for example)
            -   This does correlate to learning, in part because the matching style is more interesting (less self-distraction)
        -   Most lessons have a best presentation style (stacks might be best taught visually, for example)
            -   This trumps preferences in the studies I've seen; better the right medium for the topic than the prefered medium of the student
        -   Everyone learns best if shown the information in several styles
    -   Hence, switch it up.  Prepare ways to present each topic in 2+ styles.

5.  Discussion of tutoring practices and this framework
