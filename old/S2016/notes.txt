1st-time TA observations
    1. Kevin Sullivan's 1113 is the right approach to CS1.  I have never seen so much consensus of praise from TAs for a course before.
    2. 2110 should (0) be different in some way; (1) be harder, particularly with more homework; (2) teach git and use github; (3) not include software models and methodologies.  But beyond that no consensus; each paper on this topic basically took some other course (2150, 2102, 3240, 4970) and said "do part of this in 2110" (with a few that said simply "remove 2110, we don't need it at all").
    3. 3240 isn't quite right... somehow.  Most TAs who mentioned 3240s seemed to me to be stumbling about for why it felt off-target without any great insight.
