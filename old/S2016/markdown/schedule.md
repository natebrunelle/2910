Schedule
========
The main time commitment of this course is being a TA.  Three hours per week of your TAship this semester is unpaid and counts as the principle assignment of this course.  If you are enrolled for two or more credits of 2501, you need to work (credits × 3) hours per week unpaid for this course.  There will also be some meetings and other activities, as outlined below.

Some sessions will be mandatory (topics like ethics and diversity) and others optional (topics like learning theories and TPEGS).  You will be required to attend a subset of the optional sessions.  Attending additional instances of the same session does not count toward your minimum optional session count.

In any given week, all four times will be the same topic and attending any slot is fine.



## Scheduled Optional Sessions

These were selected from your votes using iterated instant runoff.  Single transferable vote might perhaps have been better, but I didn't happen to have code for that lying around.
