title: TA Practicum
...


This course is for teaching assistants in computer science courses.
Each teaching assistant is required to take it their first semester TAing for a CS course.
TAs in other departments may be admitted on a case-by-case basis.
See [Your Grade] for why non-TAs cannot pass this course.

Many faculty hire their TAs during the first few weeks of class.
Because of that, CS 2910 will not begin in earnest until the third week of the semester.

I will begin granting SIS permissions around the time classes start.
You'll need to accept those promptly or they will expire.
If you have any difficulty, please contact me at [njb2b@virginia.edu](mailto:njb2b@virginia.edu?subject=CS 2910 enrollment).


# Two ways to participate

Each week we'll cover one topic.
You can pick either

- Attend a scheduled session and participate in the discussion, or
- Learn the material from the videos and/or writeup and then take an online quiz


You are welcome to do both, but only one of the two is required.
You may pick and choose between the two options each week.
Past students have generally had a much more positive experience in the course iwhen attending live discussions, so I highly recommend that you select that option. The asynchronous option is intended mostly for students with travel constraints, illnesses, or scheduling challenges.

Meeting times
:   Wednesdays 2pm-2:50pm in MEC 213
:   Thursdays 5pm-5:50pm in MEC 213
:   Fridays 1pm-1:50pm in MEC 213
:   Fridays 4pm-4:50pm in MEC 213
    
    Each meeting in a given week will cover the same material.
    Attending more than one in a single week is not encouraged.

SIS's handling of permission-request courses is a bit tricky.
If you tried but failed to enroll, or if you were hired after the add deadline,
please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/WjU2johr3ELyGzhg7)

:::aside
Did you know UVA gives each student three IDs?

- Student ID, a 9- or 10-digit number of their ID card
- Computing ID, letters with one digit, often abbreviated `mst3k` because the authors of the computing ID documentation needed a demo ID and were fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000
- SIS ID, also called employee ID, a row ID in the database table of students; currently (Fall 2020) in the 2,500,000--2,800,000 range and increasing every year

Late add enrollments need the SIS ID, not one of the others.

# Topics

There are seven requred, graded modules, each with several topics.
Each topic is accompanied by both a writeup and a video. The intent is that both video and writuep cover the same material so that you may choose either to learn the material.
There is also an orientiation module to help you have a smooth start to TAing,
as well as several optional, ungraded enrichment modules.

    1. Once this week, get a student to act on something not directly part of their assignment: to draw, to write, to explain, to try something out, etc.
    1. Pick one of the situations discussed this week that comes up the most often in your class, and try out one of the suggestions from this week's material that you don't usually use. Did it work?

Assignment
:   1. Observe someone else teaching. Write down your thoughts on
        a. What they did that you don't?
        a. Why you think they chose to do that?
        a. Who was that choice helping the most?
        a. How could you apply that in your teaching?
    1. Record or reflect on your own teaching. Identify something you should do more or less of.
    1. Ask someone who has seen you teach for feedback on what you could improve. This might mean inviting them to see you teach first, perhaps even in a role-play situation where they pretend to be a student.
    1. Reflect on what you'll take from TAing into whatever you do next. Write down a personal goal related to this.

# Your Grade

Your assessments in this course run as follows:

- 35% modules; 5% for each of the 7 required modules
    
    You can pass a module either by (a) participating in a live session or (b) taking a quiz.
    
    Quizzes are delivered online and are retakeable.
    They are administered by Google, which is a bit harsh when it comes to multiple-select (you get points only for a perfect answer), but hopefully the repeatability will help with that.
    There is no limit to the number of times you may retake each quiz.

- 15% final paper

    The end of term paper will be due the last day of classes and should address **one** of the following topics:
        
    1.  **Curriculum redesign.**  Propose a redrawing of lines between courses, including any changes to the required/elective category of each course for BACS, BSCS, BSCpE, and/or CS Minor; defend why that reorganization would improve the educational quality of our program. Include any risks you can think of: what might make the change fail?

    2.  **Course improvement.**  Propose specific changes to the content, assignments, and/or flow of the course you are TAing. Try to be clear on how this would change the workload of course staff and the expected benefits to the students. Include any risks you can think of: what might make the change fail?

    3.  **What I wish I had known about TAing**… but nobody told me (or they did but I didn't understand in advance). Reflect on your TAing experience and note what you had to learn the hard way, what you still haven't learned, and what advice or training you wish you had received before you started.
    
    To upload your paper for grading
    
    a. Export your paper as a PDF document (PDF only, please)
    a. Visit Collab → File Drop
    a. To the right of your name you should see a drop-down button which may be labeled "⏷" or "Actions ⏷"; click that and pick "Upload Files"
    
    Grading of this paper is looking for thought and attention, not "correctness".
    
    There's no particular length limit; both ½-page and 15-page papers could earn full credit. Say what you have to say, and then stop.

- 50% your supervisor's response to "on a scale from A to F, how effective was this TA?"
