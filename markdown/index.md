title: TA Practicum
...

This semester, the TA practicum will be offered as an online asynchronous course.
This means there will be no scheduled meeting times; you'll be expected to learn the material at your own pace.

There will be scheduled discussion times when you are invited to come, talk, and share ideas with the instructor and with other TAs.
Although you may not know TAs from other courses yet, many TAs are students who study well, can explain things clearly, and want to give back to the university; we expect you'll find one another quite pleasant to get to know.

Traditionally, TA hiring extends into the first few weeks of the semester.
Thus, this course is designed to begin in the third week of the semester.
While some material may appear before then, there is no need to start work early.

This course is designed to take about 4 hours of your time per week for 8 weeks, for a total of 32 hours.

# Topics

The first seven topics are required, and the intent is to make them available via writeup, video, and podcast, instructor time permitting.
The 8^th^ is enrichment material and will be developed in the level of detail that time allows.

    2. Once this week, after interacting with a student, summarize to them the main points you discussed.
    3. Pick an upcoming topic you know students will struggle with. Come up with, or collect from other TAs, two ways to explain that topic, one visual and one not.
    4. Come up with an analogy for a topic in your course. Share it on this course's Discord's `#analogies` channel. See Collab for the Discord join link.
    5. Once this week, try helping a student by only asking questions. See how long you can go (but stop before the student gets frustrated).

# Grading

Your assessments in this course run as follows:

- 35% topical quizzes; 5% for each of the 7 required topics
    
    These will be delivered online and be retakeable.
    I have not yet written them, so I cannot yet provide more details.

- 15% final paper

    The end of term paper will be due the last day of classes and should address **one** of the following topics:
        
    1.  **Curriculum redesign.**  Propose a redrawing of lines between courses, including any changes to the required/elective category of each course for BACS, BSCS, and/or BSCpE; defend why that reorganization would improve the educational quality of our program. Include any risks you can think of: what might make the change fail?

    2.  **Course improvement.**  Propose specific changes to the content, assignments, and/or flow of the course you are TAing. Try to be clear on how this would change the workload of course staff and the expected benefits to the students. Include any risks you can think of: what might make the change fail?

    3.  **What I wish I had known about TAing**â€¦ but nobody told me. Reflect on your TAing experience and note what you had to learn the hard way, what you still haven't learned, and what advice or training you wish you had received before you started.
    
    Grading of this paper is looking for thought and attention, not "correctness".

- 50% your supervisor's response to "on a scale from A to F, how effective was this TA?"
