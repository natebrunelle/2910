title: TA Practicum
...

This semester, the TA practicum will be offered as an online asynchronous course.
This means there will be no scheduled meeting times; you'll be expected to learn the material at your own pace.

There will be scheduled discussion times when you are invited to come, talk, and share ideas with the instructor and with other TAs.
Although you may not know TAs from other courses yet, many TAs are students who study well, can explain things clearly, and want to give back to the university; we expect you'll find one another quite pleasant to get to know.

Traditionally, TA hiring extends into the first few weeks of the semester.
Thus, this course is designed to begin in the third week of the semester.
While some material may appear before then, there is no need to start work early.

This course is designed to take about 4 hours of your time per week for 8 weeks, for a total of 32 hours.

# Enrollment

You must be a TA for a course in the CS department to pass this class (see [Grading] for why non-TAs will always get Fs).
With rare exceptions, you must take it during your first semester TAing for CS.

SIS's handling of permission-request courses is a bit tricky.

:::aside
Did you know UVA gives each student three IDs?

- Student ID, a 9- or 10-digit number of their ID card
- Computing ID, letters with one digit, often abbreviated `mst3k` because the authors of the computing ID documentation needed a demo ID and were fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000
- SIS ID, also called employee ID, a row ID in the database table of students; currently (Fall 2020) in the 2,500,000--2,800,000 range and increasing every year

Late add enrollments need the SIS ID, not one of the others.

# Topics

The first seven topics are required, and the intent is to make them available via writeup, video, and podcast, instructor time permitting.
The 8^th^ is enrichment material and will be developed in the level of detail that time allows.

    1. Ask a friend from a different culture than you if you use any words or phrases they find annoying or offensive.

# Grading

Your assessments in this course run as follows:

- 35% topical quizzes; 5% for each of the 7 required topics
    
    These will be delivered online and be retakeable.
    I have not yet written them, so I cannot yet provide more details.

- 15% final paper

    The end of term paper will be due the last day of classes and should address **one** of the following topics:
        
    1.  **Curriculum redesign.**  Propose a redrawing of lines between courses, including any changes to the required/elective category of each course for BACS, BSCS, and/or BSCpE; defend why that reorganization would improve the educational quality of our program. Include any risks you can think of: what might make the change fail?

    2.  **Course improvement.**  Propose specific changes to the content, assignments, and/or flow of the course you are TAing. Try to be clear on how this would change the workload of course staff and the expected benefits to the students. Include any risks you can think of: what might make the change fail?

    3.  **What I wish I had known about TAing**… but nobody told me. Reflect on your TAing experience and note what you had to learn the hard way, what you still haven't learned, and what advice or training you wish you had received before you started.
    
    Grading of this paper is looking for thought and attention, not "correctness".

- 50% your supervisor's response to "on a scale from A to F, how effective was this TA?"
