title: CS Education Practicum a.k.a. TA Practicum (Fall 2022)
...


# Welcome!
Welcome to CS 2910 - CS Education Practicum!

This course is for teaching assistants in computer science courses.
Each teaching assistant is required to take it their first semester TAing for a CS course.
TAs in other departments may be admitted on a case-by-case basis.
See [Your Grade] for why non-TAs cannot pass this course.

Many faculty hire their TAs during the first few weeks of class.
Because of that, CS 2910 will not begin in earnest until a few weeks into the semester.

You all have been granted SIS permissions to enroll in this course. I look forward to working with you this semester!
If you have any questions or concerns about the course, please contact me at [basit@virginia.edu](mailto:basit@virginia.edu?subject=CS 2910 Question/Concern).


# Participation

**Two Ways To Participate:**

Each week we'll cover one topic.
You can pick either:

- Attend a scheduled session and participate in the discussion, or
- Learn the material from the videos and/or writeup and then take an online quiz


You are welcome to do both, but only one of the two is required.
You may pick and choose between the two options each week.
Past students have generally had a much more positive experience in the course when attending live discussions, so I highly recommend that you select that option. The asynchronous option is intended mostly for students with travel constraints, illnesses, or scheduling challenges.

Meeting times
:   Mondays 10:00-10:50am in RICE 032
:   Wednesdays 2:30-3:20pm in OLS 001
:   Wednesdays 3:30-4:20pm in RICE 032
:   Fridays 2:30-3:20pm in RICE 032
:   Fridays 4:00pm-4:50pm in RICE 032
    
    Each meeting in a given week will cover the same material.
    Attending more than one in a single week is **not** encouraged.

**Office Hours**
:   There are no official office hours for this course

    However, you are most welcome to schedule an appointment with me if you wish to talk about the content of the course. Please [email me](mailto:basit@virginia.edu?subject=CS 2910 office hour request) with some days and times you are available so we can schedule an appointment to meet (either in person or on Zoom.) 

## Expectations: In-Person vs. Fully Asynchronous

For those students whose schedules **cannot** accommodate ANY of the meetings times this semester (see Section 2) - ***don't worry!*** You have the ability to fully participate **asynchronously**. Please see the "Fully Asynchronous Expectations" section below for details.  For all other students, we expect that you will participate **in-person throughout the semester**. Please see the "In-Person Expectations" section below for details. 

**In-Person Expectations**

:   As mentioned, past students generally have a much more positive experience in the course when attending live discussions. Engaging with the material helps you learn the content, and you have the opportunity to discuss with your TA-peers as well as ask any me any questions that you have. Therefore, I highly recommend that you select this option for the rest of the semester. As long as you attend in-person, you do not have to take the quiz. However, you are encouraged (although not required) to read the module writeups and watch the module videos.
    
    While I hope you all will do your best to attend **in-person each week** I understand that things come up (e.g., you may have some travel constraints, illnesses, or one-off scheduling conflicts). In these circumstances please participate asynchronously for that week by following the three (3) steps for asynchronous participation. Please see the "Fully Asynchronous Expectations" section below for details.  

**Fully Asynchronous Expectations**

:   For those of you who are unable to attend ANY meeting times due to conflicts in your schedule, we ask that you participate **asynchronously** on a weekly basis. Each week we will cover an important topic, and expect that you will participate by:    
:   (i) reading the available writeups and watching the available videos in the Topics section (section 4), 
:   (ii) carrying out the assignment for that module, and 
:   (iii) taking the **module quiz**
    
    Quizzes are delivered online and are retakeable. They are administered by Google, which is a bit harsh when it comes to multiple-select (you get points only for a perfect answer), but hopefully the repeatability will help with that.


# <span style="color:navy">**Schedule:**</span>

You will gain the most by attending these discussion session in-person. I understand, of course, that the meeting times provided above might not suit everybody's schedules.

SIS's handling of permission-request courses is a bit tricky.
If you tried but failed to enroll, or if you were hired after the add deadline,
please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/WjU2johr3ELyGzhg7)

:::aside
Did you know UVA gives each student three IDs?

- Student ID, a 9- or 10-digit number of their ID card
- Computing ID, letters with one digit, often abbreviated `mst3k` because the authors of the computing ID documentation needed a demo ID and were fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000
- SIS ID, also called employee ID, a row ID in the database table of students; currently (Fall 2020) in the 2,500,000--2,800,000 range and increasing every year

Late add enrollments need the SIS ID, not one of the others.

# Topics

There are seven requred, graded modules, each with several topics.
Each topic is usually accompanied by both a writeup and a video. The intent is that both video and writuep cover the same material so that you may choose either to learn the material.
There is also an orientiation module to help you have a smooth start to TAing,
as well as several optional, ungraded enrichment modules.

<span style="color:red">**Note about the videos:**</span> These videos are from a past semester and there might be some differences between how this course is taught this semester and how the course was taught that semester. All pertinent details are available here on this website. If in doubt about anything, please ask your instructor!

    1. Record or reflect on your own teaching. Identify something you should do more or less of.
    1. Ask someone who has seen you teach for feedback on what you could improve. This might mean inviting them to see you teach first, perhaps even in a role-play situation where they pretend to be a student.
    1. Reflect on what you'll take from TAing into whatever you do next. Write down a personal goal related to this.

<span style="color:magenta">**More Topics Will Show Up Here As The Semester Progresses...!**</span>

# Your Grade

Your assessments in this course run as follows:

- <span style="color:blue">35% modules</span>; 5% for each of the 7 required modules
    
    You can pass a module either by (a) participating in a live session or (b) reading the writeups, watching the videos, and taking a quiz. (See "Expectations: In-Person vs. Fully Asynchronous" for more details.)
    
    <span style="color:green">Note: ***everybody*** will be marked as passing the "Orientation" (September 19-23) required module!</span>
    
    **Expectation** I understand some percentage of the class might not be able to attend any of the scheduled times for the course, but the majority of you can. For those who can attend at least one of the scheduled times, attend in-person a minimum of 5 times, and take the quiz a maximum of 2 times.
    
    - If you attend synchronously all 7 times (for the required modules), I'll waive the final essay provided that you contribute!
    
    - If you attend all of the Guest Speakers, you will be given a bonus added onto your final course score!
    
    Quizzes are delivered online and are retakeable.
    They are administered by Google, which is a bit harsh when it comes to multiple-select (you get points only for a perfect answer), but hopefully the repeatability will help with that. (Note: if the quiz location changes, you will be alerted via an announcement.)
    There is no limit to the number of times you may retake each quiz.

- <span style="color:blue">15% final paper</span>

    The end of term paper will be due the last day of classes and should address **one** of the following topics:
        
    1.  **Curriculum redesign.**  Propose a redrawing of lines between courses, including any changes to the required/elective category of each course for BACS, BSCS, BSCpE, and/or CS Minor; defend why that reorganization would improve the educational quality of our program. Include any risks you can think of: what might make the change fail?

    2.  **Course improvement.**  Propose specific changes to the content, assignments, and/or flow of the course you are TAing. Try to be clear on how this would change the workload of course staff and the expected benefits to the students. Include any risks you can think of: what might make the change fail?

    3.  **What I wish I had known about TAing**… but nobody told me (or they did but I didn't understand in advance). Reflect on your TAing experience and note what you had to learn the hard way, what you still haven't learned, and what advice or training you wish you had received before you started.
