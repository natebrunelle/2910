+===============+============================================================+
|Who may enroll?|Any person employed as a Teaching Assistant (TA) in CS.     |
|               |<br/>If you TA but not in CS and your supervisor agrees,    |
|               |you may also enroll, but email the CS 2910 instructor (CCing|
|               |your supervisor) before doing so.                           |

# Enrollment

You must be a TA for a course in the CS department to pass this class (see [Your Grade] for why non-TAs will always get Fs).
With rare exceptions, you must take it during your first semester TAing for CS.

If you have any difficulty, please contact the CS 2910 instructor at [tychonievich@virginia.edu](mailto:tychonievich@virginia.edu?subject=CS 2910 enrollment).

<!--

SIS's handling of permission-request courses is a bit tricky.
If you tried but failed to enroll, or if you were hired after the add deadline,
please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/WjU2johr3ELyGzhg7)

:::aside
Did you know UVA gives each student three IDs?

- Student ID, a 9- or 10-digit number of their ID card
- Computing ID, letters with one digit, often abbreviated `mst3k` because the authors of the computing ID documentation needed a demo ID and were fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000
- SIS ID, also called employee ID, a row ID in the database table of students; currently (Fall 2020) in the 2,500,000--2,800,000 range and increasing every year

Late add enrollments need the SIS ID, not one of the others.

# Synchronous Meetings

Each week we hold three **optional** synchronous meetings:
**Monday at 2pm**, **Tuesday at 4pm**, and **Thursday at 10am**.
The zoom link for these is [in collab](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/45cf3187-9c89-4ec5-a259-4f0dce511ec9/page-reset/418828c7-696e-4964-b396-85f3585f8770).

Each week, our meetings will run in the following priority:

1. I'll field questions about the learning material from the module highlighted for that week (see below).
2. I'll field other questions from your TAing experience.
3. I'll explain material and/or do activities with you.

Each meeting will last no more than 45 minutes.
The module highlight schedule is as follows:

# Topics

There are seven requred, graded modules, each with several topics.
Each topic is accompanied by both a writeup and a video. The intent is that both video and writuep cover the same material so that you may choose either to learn the material.
There is also an orientiation module to help you have a smooth start to TAing,
as well as several optional, ungraded enrichment modules.

Assignment
:   1. Observe someone else teaching. Write down your thoughts on
        a. What they did that you don't?
        a. Why you think they chose to do that?
        a. Who was that choice helping the most?
        a. How could you apply that in your teaching?
    1. Record or reflect on your own teaching. Identify something you should do more or less of.
    1. Ask someone who has seen you teach for feedback on what you could improve. This might mean inviting them to see you teach first, perhaps even in a role-play situation where they pretend to be a student.
    1. Reflect on what you'll take from TAing into whatever you do next. Write down a personal goal related to this.

# Your Grade

Your assessments in this course run as follows:

- 35% module quizzes; 5% for each of the 7 required modules
    
    These are delivered online and are retakeable.
    They are administered by Google, which is a bit harsh when it comes to multiple-select (you get points only for a perfect answer), but hopefully the repeatability will help with that.

- 15% final paper

    The end of term paper will be due the last day of classes and should address **one** of the following topics:
        
    1.  **Curriculum redesign.**  Propose a redrawing of lines between courses, including any changes to the required/elective category of each course for BACS, BSCS, BSCpE, and/or CS Minor; defend why that reorganization would improve the educational quality of our program. Include any risks you can think of: what might make the change fail?

    2.  **Course improvement.**  Propose specific changes to the content, assignments, and/or flow of the course you are TAing. Try to be clear on how this would change the workload of course staff and the expected benefits to the students. Include any risks you can think of: what might make the change fail?

    3.  **What I wish I had known about TAing**… but nobody told me (or they did but I didn't understand in advance). Reflect on your TAing experience and note what you had to learn the hard way, what you still haven't learned, and what advice or training you wish you had received before you started.
    
    To upload your paper for grading
    
    a. Export your paper as a PDF document (PDF only, please)
    a. Visit Collab → File Drop
    a. To the right of your name you should see a drop-down button which may be labeled "⏷" or "Actions ⏷"; click that and pick "Upload Files"
    
    Grading of this paper is looking for thought and attention, not "correctness".
    
    There's no particular length limit; I've given full credit to both ½-page and 15-page papers in the past. Say what you have to say, and then stop.

- 50% your supervisor's response to "on a scale from A to F, how effective was this TA?"

You can see a summary of your grade so far at <https://kytos.cs.virginia.edu/cs2910/grade.php>
